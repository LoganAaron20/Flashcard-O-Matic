# Flashcard-O-Matic

## Discover the flashcard difference

### This Flashcard app was created using React and Bootstrap 4. This application allows users to create decks of cards. The app is fully functional allowing for users to study whatever concepts they need.


### The current build only works locally

[Thikful](https://Thinkful.com) led me to create this app as my second capstone while enrolled. This app was created to test my abilities to create an application using React. Along with basic understandings of React, it tested my ability to debug efficiently withing my React application, and use React tools, such as `useState()` and `useEffect()` hooks.
